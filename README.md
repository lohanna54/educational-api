# Educational Api

This API allows us to manage the students and classes of an educational institution.

It is the final project that was proposed in the [immersive C# course](https://github.com/lohanna54/coding-girls-exercises) taught by [BlueEdTech](https://blueedtech.com.br/), where I seek to continuously apply the concepts I am learning with this language. Between them:

- .Net Framework;
- Entity Framework;
- SQL Server;
- Microsoft Azure.

## Acceptance criteria

- Publishing in the Azure cloud (database and API) ✔
- Class and Student CRUD endpoints tested in postman without errors, with business rules ✔
